# julia-rs

[![Project Status: Concept - Minimal or no implementation has been done yet.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

A Rust library for calling Julia.
Julia needs to be installed with libjulia available in /usr/local/lib or similar.

This doesn't do much of anything yet but stay tuned.
